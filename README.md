The dataset for this project was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011). The features of this dataset are hourly average ambient variables that include: 
AT: ambient temperature<
AP: ambient pressure
RH: relative humidity
V: exhaust vacuum
<br>Which are used to predict the continual target variable EP that consists of the net hourly electrical energy output of the plant
