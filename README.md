This project utilizes a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consisting of 9,568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over a six-year period, from 2006 to 2011. The dataset is rich in features, capturing hourly average ambient variables that impact the plant’s performance. These features include:

AT: Ambient Temperature
AP: Ambient Pressure
RH: Relative Humidity
V: Exhaust Vacuum
The goal is to use these ambient variables to predict the continuous target variable EP, which represents the net hourly electrical energy output of the power plant. By analyzing the relationships between these environmental factors and the plant's energy output, the project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the plant’s performance under varying conditions. This model could potentially be used to optimize plant operations, improve energy efficiency, and contribute to better resource management in power generation
